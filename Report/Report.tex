        \subsection{Description}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item user: A user account who's only relation is to their orders. Orders can only be linked to one user, but a user can have many orders.
                \item order: Order details. Order items can only link to one order but an order can have many items. Orders can only have one user
                \item book: A book can only have 1 publisher, but can be in muliple orders, carried by multiple bookstores, and be in multiple restocks.
                \item publisher: A publisher can publish multiple books, send multiple restock shipments, and have multiple phones.
                \item phone: phone is a weak entity because it's existence is entirely defined by a publisher. A phone can only tie to one publisher, but a publisher may have multiple phone numbers.
                \item shipment: A shipment can only be sent from one publisher to one bookstore, bute contain multiple books to restock.
                \item bookstore: A bookstore can carry multiple books and receive multiple restock shipments.
            \end{itemize}
        \subsection{Notes}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The project description states ``When checkingout,  the user inserts billing and shipping information (can be different than those used in registration)''.
                This implies that billing and shipping should be inputted upon registration. I chose not to implement this because it poses an unnecessary security risk for users who have never made an order.
            \end{itemize}
    \section{Reduction to Relation Schema}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $orders(\underline{user\_id}, \underline{order\_num})$
            \item $item(\underline{order\_num}, \underline{isbn})$
            \item $publishes(\underline{isbn}, \underline{publisher})$
            \item $ships(\underline{pub\_name}, \underline{shipment\_id})$
            \item $contains(\underline{isbn}, \underline{shipment\_id}, quantity)$
            \item $receives(\underline{store\_id}, \underline{shipment\_id})$
            \item $carries(\underline{store\_id}, \underline{isbn}, price, quantity, pub\_cut)$
            \item $threshold(\underline{store\_id}, \underline{isbn}, threshold)$
        \end{itemize}
    \section{Normalization of Relation Schema}
        The relations in this database have been designed to have minimal functional dependencies. This results in the relations already decomposed. This can be seen by the following.
        \subsection{orders}
            $a$ is $user\_id$, $b$ is $order\_num$ \\
            $ab$ is a superkey for orders, \\ 
            $a$ does not imply $b$, $b$ does not imply $a$, therefore orders is fully decomposed
        \subsection{item}
            $a$ is $order\_num$, $b$ is $isbn$ \\
            $ab$ is a superkey for item, \\ 
            $a$ does not imply $b$, $b$ does not imply $a$, therefore item is fully decomposed
        \subsection{publishes}
            $a$ is $isbn$, $b$ is $publisher$ \\
            $ab$ is a superkey for publishes \\ 
            $a$ does not imply $b$, $b$ does not imply $a$, therefore publishes is fully decomposed
        \subsection{ships}
            $a$ is $pub\_name$, $b$ is $shipment\_id)$, \\
            $ab$ is a superkey for ships, \\
            $a$ does not imply $b$, $b$ does not imply $a$, therefore ships is fully decomposed
        \subsection{contains}
            $a$ is $isbn$, $b$ is $shipment\_id$, $c$ is $quantity$, \\
            $ab$ is a superkey,
            $ab \rightarrow c$, therefore receives is fully decomposed
        \subsection{receives}
            $a$ is $store\_id$, $b$ is $shipment\_id)$, \\
            $ab$ is a superkey for receives, \\
            $a$ does not imply $b$, $b$ does not imply $a$, therefore receives is fully decomposed
        \subsection{carries}
            $a$ is $store\_id$, $b$ is $isbn$, $c$ is $price$, $d$ is $quantity$, $e$ is $pub\_cut$, \\
            $ab$ is a superkey for carries, \\
            $ab \rightarrow c$, $ab \rightarrow d$, $ab \rightarrow e$. Due to the uniqueness and required population of $c$, $d$, and $e$, this system should not be decomposed.
        \subsection{threshold}
            $a$ is $store\_id$, $b$ is $isbn$, $c$ is $price$, \\
            $ab$ is a superkey for threshold, \\
            $ab$ implies $c$, therefore threshold is fully decomposed. Previously this was a part of carries, but, due to the potential NULL state of threshold, it was decomposed out.
